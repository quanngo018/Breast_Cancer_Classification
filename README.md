# Breast Cancer Prediction using MLP (Keras)

This project uses a basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify tumors in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset as malignant or benign. Built and tested entirely in Google Colab using Keras. I also built from scratch to understand the algorithm.

## 📌 Overview

- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- Task: Binary classification (malignant / benign)
- Frameworks: Python, Keras, NumPy, scikit-learn, Google Colab
